## Class/Repository Description

*COSC420 - High-Performance Computing.*


**Class:** 

The course will study principles, practices, and implementations of parallel and distributed computing. It covers three areas of high performance computing: modern computing architectures, algorithm design, and applications and programming. Through this course, students will not only learn fundamental concepts of high performance computing but also gain hands-on hardware and programming experience in this field.

**Repository:**

This repository will include any labs, homeworks, projects, or other material related to the class which requires coding.  This also includes any optional work completed by myself for enrichment in the same studies/topics discussed and practiced in this class (COSC420).  There may also be any written work uploaded for the sake of being documented and saved for future reference.

## Projects

### Project Euler: 3 problems

*Please see the Project_Euler directory.  We solved 3 problems in parallel: #145, 211, and 433.*

### arXiv Search Engine [Pagerank, HITS]

*'Ring' aka 'Research Bing.' This is still in the works.*

### Simulated Annealing.

Serial implementation complete for SA on the Traveling Salesman Problem.
TODO: Increase visuals for the timing of serial.
