# COSC420 Lab-1

by Justin Ventura & Blaine Mason

## Questions to answer:

- (a) What is the theoretical time complexity of your sorting algorithms (best and worst case), in terms
of the input size?

Given an input size N, the worst case would be O(√N / p) where p is the number of nodes.  This is of course a

- (b) According to the data, does adding more nodes perfectly divide the time taken by the program?

- (c) Justify/prove the fact that one needs only check up to √N in the brute force primality test.

- (d) How could the code be improved in terms of usability, efficiency, and robustness?
