# COSC420 Lab-2

by Justin Ventura & Blaine Mason

## How to run the program:
<code>making a makefile</code>

## Questions to answer:

### (a) What is the theoretical time complexity of your algorithms (best and worst case), in terms of the input size?

### (b) According to the data, does adding more nodes perfectly divide the time taken by the program?

### (c) What are some real-world software examples that would need the above routines? Why? Would they benefit greatly from using your distributed code?

### (d) How could the code be improved in terms of usability, efficiency, and robustness?
